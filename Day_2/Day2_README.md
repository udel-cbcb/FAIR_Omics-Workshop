# Day 2 README and Overview

A summary of each of the materials from Day 2 of the FAIR Data Practices for Omics Analysis Workshop.

### **Activity:** [Assignment report out](Day1_hw_doc_example/day1_seq_id_exercise.md)

Participants discuss their answers to the Day 1 take-home assignment and the correct answers are revealed.

### **Lecture:** [Computational notebooks](Day_2/D2_computational_notebooks.pdf)

Keeping a log of computational work is a difficult task.  This lecture covers the basics of documenting computational work, notebook organization strategies, available notebook software, and how record-keeping ties in to FAIR data practices. 

### **Activity:** Documenting computational work

In this activity, an instructor reviews how to properly document the homework assignment from Day 1.

### **Lecture:** [Overview of omics analysis](Day_2/D2-Omics.pdf)

A summary of sequencing techniques from its origins to 3rd generation, omics analysis of all kinds, and their relationships.

### **Tutorial:** [HPC and Biomix](Day_2/D2-HPC_Basics-Slides.pdf)

A guide to running commands and scripts on UD's high-performance computing cluster Biomix.

### **Assignment:** [Biomix exercise](Day_2/D2-BLAST-Tutorial.md)

In this assignment, participants use BLAST on Biomix rather than the web application to complete part of the homework assignment from Day 1.
