###**Tutorial:** [SNP Tutorial 4: Viewing and decorating your tree](Day_5/5-SNP_Project-Tutorial_4.md)

Participants use Iroki to view and customize a phylogenetic tree resulting from their SNP analysis.

###**Demonstration:** Depositing sequence data in NCBI repositories

Instructors demonstrate the process of depositing sequencing data to the SRA.

###**Lecture:** [Other data repositories](Day_5/D5_Other_Data_Repositories.pdf)

An overview of popular data repositories that have not yet been covered and their uses.  These include specialized repositories (e.g., the Protein Data Bank) and more general repositories (e.g., GitHub, Zenodo, FigShare).
