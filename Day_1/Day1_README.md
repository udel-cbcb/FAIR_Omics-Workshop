And are then presented with side by side comparisons of good and bad data records.


### **Tutorial:** [Web-based resources](D1-Web_Resources_Tutorial.pdf)

In this tutorial, participants learn how to use important web-based bioinformatics resources, including NCBI, BLAST, and UniProt.


### **Assignment:** [Web-based bioinformatics exercise](Web_Resources-Day1_Assignment.md)
