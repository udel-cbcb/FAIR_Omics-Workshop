# Day 4 README and Overview

A summary of each of the materials from Day 4 of the FAIR Data Practices for Omics Analysis Workshop.

###**Lecture:** [Genomic variants](Day_4/D4_Genomic_Variants.pdf)

An overview of mutations and their sources, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and single nucleotide variants (SNVs).

###**Lecture:** [Mis-annotations](Day_4/D4-Misannotations_and_Data_Sources.pdf)

The story of how the misannotation of a single protein led an entire field astray;  a cautionary tale about checking data sources.

###**Lecture:** [Genomic Variant Analysis (SNP) Analysis](Day_4/D4_Variant_Analysis.pdf)

An introduction to performing SNP/SNV analysis.

###**Tutorial:** [SNP Tutorial 1: QC and trimming](Day_4/1-SNP_Project-Tutorial_1.md)

In this tutorial, participants choose the samples they want to analyze for variants and perform quality control (QC) on the sequencing reads.  

###**Lecture:** [Interoperability](Day_4/D4-Interoperability_file_formats.pdf)

A guide to common file formats in bioinformatics and the the importance of using standardized formats to ensure interoperability of data.

###**Tutorial:** [SNP Tutorial 2: Reference mapping & variant detection](Day_4/2-SNP_Project-Tutorial_2.md)

In this tutorial, participants map the quality controlled reads from SNP Tutorial 1 against the reference genome and perform variant detection.

###**Assignment:** [Complete variant detection](Day_4/3-SNP_Project-Day4_Assignment.md)

Finally, participants complete the steps of variant detection as a take-home assignment.
