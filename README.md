# FAIR_Omics-Workshop
Welcome to the FAIR Data Practices for Omics Analysis workshop. 

Technological advances in instrumentation for generating genomics, proteomics, and related data have made these high-throughput, data intensive technologies an indispensable part of biological research.  Concurrent advances in computational infrastructure and data science methodologies have not only allowed analysis of these data for their original purpose, but have enabled subsequent reanalysis of such data by other investigators to meet other scientific objectives.  This emerging paradigm has underscored the need for practices that make such data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR).  This workshop will provide primarily laboratory based scientists with the knowledge and tools they need to apply FAIR practices in their own research.
